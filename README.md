Docker-compose for running locally https://gist.github.com/RahulTandon1/f2f41f3e150f37bfdd4ade2a821ef5f9 (but will need to manually change the NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL in the frontend's Dockerfile). Please see the frontend repo for more details: https://github.com/RahulTandon1/carta-frontend


I know I was meant to make the frontend for Carta
but to be honest given my time constraints this is what I could pull off. I prioritized doing the backend because that is what I claimed I'm good at.
Deploying to GCP wasn't as easy as I thought despite the previous AWS experience. I would rather build & submit something rather than nothing.
I am thankful for this task to have pushed me to build with Golang. Had not worked with it before. Was fun hacking with it with Cursor & ChatGPT's help.
