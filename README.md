I know I was meant to make the frontend for Carta
but to be honest given my time constraints this is what I could pull off. I prioritized doing the backend because that is what I claimed I'm good at.
Deploying to GCP wasn't as easy as I thought despite the previous AWS experience. I would rather build & submit something rather than nothing.
